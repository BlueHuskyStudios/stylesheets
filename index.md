This is a host and repository for stylesheets that [Blue Husky Studios](https://BHStudios.org) uses for various
projects. Here is how they are structured:


# Neon #

Neon is the latest general-purpose website theme by Blue Husky Studios. It takes cues from Google's Material Design,
as well as the bright and fun colors of the neo-retro-80s-aesthetic.

 * **[Neon Renderer](./assets/v2/neon/neon-renderer.css)** takes variables from the following Neon themes and renders them into a full theme
 * **[Neon Fire](./assets/v2/neon/neon-fire.css)** uses a bright amber and accents it with a bright cyan, like wood and gas flames
 * **[Neon Water](./assets/v2/neon/neon-water.css)** shows off a beautiful deep blue with accents in a soft yellow, like the sun off a Caribbean lagoon
